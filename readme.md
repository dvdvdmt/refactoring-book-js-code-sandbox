## About

This repo contains a code sample of original problem described in
[Refactoring book](https://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoring-2nd-ed.html).
The aim of this project is to provide a starting point for those who want to
follow refactoring process while reading the book.

Just install dependencies with `npm i` and periodically run tests with
`npm test` or `npm run test:watch`.

Results of refactoring process for each chapter can be seen in `chapter-*`
branches.
